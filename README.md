# Episodic reward

This code is designed to analyze and visualize the performance of different deep learning models (specifically DQNs) trained on the Atari games "Pong" and "Asteroids". The data being analyzed is the episodic reward each model achieves over the course of its training, which provides an indication of how well the model is learning to play the game.
